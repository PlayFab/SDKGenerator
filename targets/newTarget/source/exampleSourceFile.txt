This is a newtarget source file.
It is copied as is, with no modifications.

The source directory is not required, but by convention, it's the place to store files that should be copied as is.
You can have as many files and subdirectories as you want, and they're all copied.

EJS tags are ignored, so, <%- thisChunk %> is not evaluated in any way.
(If it were, it would probably throw an exception about how "thisChunk" is not a known variable)
