# Requirements for the Common SDK infrastructure
The purpose of this doc is to have a place to list and discuss all requirements to the new modular SDK infrastructure (also informally called "the Common SDK infrastructure") before creating an official design.

The information listed here was primarily sourced in a few meetings/discussions/whiteboardings we had before.

## Terminology
* _Common SDK_ is the new modular SDK. 
* _Service_ is a single building unit (module) of the new modular SDK. TODO: please let me know if another term is desired for this.
