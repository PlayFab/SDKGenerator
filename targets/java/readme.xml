            Note: gpg and gpg2 executables are identical usage-wise. Use whatever executable you find on your target machine.
            During key generation, you will need to specify passphrase
            In the end, you will obtain key with keyID
            Make sure to publish your key to one of key servers like so:
                gpg2 --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys C6EED57A
                
            Use passphrase and keyId (as keyname) to fill the section below.
