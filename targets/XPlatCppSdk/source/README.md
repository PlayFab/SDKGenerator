# XPlatCppSdk
Cross Platform C++ SDK

This SDK lets you make REST API calls to the PlayFab service. It depends on several external third-party open source libraries referenced as git submodules in directory `/external`. Please make sure to use `--recurse-submodules` command line parameter when cloning SDK's git repo:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules <git-repo-url>
```
or run the following commands to sync the content of submodules if the repo was cloned earlier without the `--recurse-submodules` parameter:

```
git submodule update --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**ATTENTION! The dependencies must be built from their source code first, before building the SDK itself.**

Please follow the instructions below precisely to build dependencies. Due to the open source nature and heavy reliance on correctly configured tools this process is very fragile.

### Building SDK's dependencies
#### Windows platform:
The files `build-dependencies-{debug|release}.bat` in the root of SDK repo simplify the process of building dependencies from source. It is based on instructions provided by the authors of third-party libraries and it uses command line utilities like `nmake`. It must be run from a specific Visual Studio's development environment command prompt: `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017` (installed with any edition of Visual Studio 2017). The operation may take several minutes but it needs to run only once.

Important! Building OpenSSL dependency from source requires specific tools installed:
* Perl 5 (http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl, 5.26.1.2601 was used). Make sure it adds to system PATH.
* NASM (Netwide Assembler) (https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.14/win64/, Win64 version 2.14 was used). Save installer on a local disk first and run it as Administrator (i.e. with elevated prompt). Make sure to add the location of NASM binaries to system PATH (manually).

Please refer to [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) for more details or if you need to customize/change the process of building dependencies.

#### Other platforms:
Please follow corresponding instructions paired with a platform's build solution/script.

BETA!

Currently, this SDK is not yet part of our normal publish pipeline, nor does it have the full testing. (We're working on this). The features that are most in need of testing are json <-> timestamp conversions, and arbitrary input/output parameters, such as WriteEvent and Cloud Script. (These two may not be fully working yet).

This source code of SDK itself is generated from our [SdkGenerator](https://github.com/PlayFab/SdkGenerator)
